# Hibernate--JPA-Complete-Course

# Hibernate & JPA

## Getting Started with Java Hibernate

1. **Setting Up Hibernate**
   - Configure a SessionFactory connection to a database
   - Use a ConfigHelper class to load Hibernate into a command-line application

2. **CRUD Operations with Hibernate**
   - Create, save, and update Java Hibernate data objects
   - Process and update transient data
   - Use the update and merge methods
   - Delete data
   - Load data
   - Manage sessions and transactions
   - Use second-level caching
   - Define custom types
   - Implement multiple mappings of tables
   - Create XML mapping between a class and a table
   - Expand the object model

3. **Advanced Hibernate Features**
   - Use the Interceptor API
   - Load applications using the JPA approach
   - Use executeUpdate for batch and bulk updates
   - Configure logging with log4j
   - Perform unique item queries
   - Allow Hibernate to create a table structure

## Customized Mapping and Basic Querying

1. **Customized Mapping Strategies**
   - Apply JOINED and Single Table strategies
   - Assign IDs using Annotations and Identity Generation
   - Use custom SQL
   - Create database indexes
   - Define property mapping
   - Configure fetching strategies (lazy and eager loading)
   - Refine basic mapping
   - Use advanced ID options
   - Work with @Table and @SecondaryTable
   - Explore advanced XML table mapping
   - Specify custom SQL in XML mappings
   - Perform detailed property mapping
   - Embed objects with @Embeddable or XML components

2. **Basic Querying with Hibernate**
   - Use HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
   - Query using the Criteria API
   - Order and paginate result data
   - Structure queries with Query by Example

3. **Advanced Querying in Java Hibernate**

    - Apply aggregations and projections to a query within a database
    - Externalize HML using annotations or an external XML file
    - Perform Hibernate Query Language (HQL) queries across multiple classes, joins, and selects
    - Use Hibernate Criteria queries with DetachedCriteria, Restrictions, and Projections
    - Conduct detailed data searches and queries across multiple tables
    - Call Hibernate stored procedures with NamedQueries and IN/OUT parameters
    - Manage XML identity mapping using basic, composite, or foreign key IDs
    - Enable SQL commenting for table creation and search queries
    - Arrange search results using Java-based methods
    - Create many-to-many relationships with @JoinTable
    - Set up @Transient annotations
    - Debug exception messages
    - Improve overall performance and query performance
    - Use immutability for read-only objects

4. **Getting Started with Hibernate**

    - Understand how Java Hibernate works with applications
    - Set up and configure Hibernate
    - Map using annotations or XML
    - Work with basic configurations (insert, update, delete)
    - Recognize differences between JPA and Hibernate
    - Configure Hibernate sessions
    - Use batch processing and multi-level caching
    - Work with custom types and filter data sets
    - Create basic tables and explore annotations
    - Understand Hibernate object states
    - Demonstrate JOINED and TABLE_PER_CLASS strategies
    - Configure identity generation using Annotations and XML
    - Explore Hibernate concepts with Oracle

5. **Deep Diving with Hibernate and Queries**
    
    - Recognize @Table and @SecondaryTable annotations
    - Create advanced XML table mapping
    - Use advanced ID options
    - Understand Hibernate and basic query concepts
    - Explore core API extensions and interfaces
    - Query using the Criteria API and advanced commands
    - Create projections, aggregations, and subqueries
    - Configure stored procedures with Oracle
    - Use Oracle comments
    - Implement Java-based sorting
    - Work with @JoinTable and @Transient annotations
    - Understand debugging concepts and performance improvements
    - Use HQL effectively for overall performance
